\cvsection[page1sidebar]{About me}
	Experienced backend developer with 10+ years in API design, software architecture, and cloud challenges. Familiar with big data and machine learning for building innovative, high-quality features. Recently gained domain expertise in the gaming industry.

	\smallskip
	Comfortable in both startups and large companies, I adapt quickly to any context. I focus on designing reliable, efficient, and resilient solutions, integrating operational needs from the start.
	I'm now looking for high-level challenges, especially those requiring solutions from scratch for complex, undefined problems. I'm passionate about creating software that balances problem-solving, long-term sustainability, and usability.

%% If the NEXT page doesn't start with a \cvsection but you'd
%% still like to add a sidebar, then use this command on THIS
%% page to add it. The optional argument lets you pull up the
%% sidebar a bit so that it looks aligned with the top of the
%% main column.
